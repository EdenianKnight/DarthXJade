# Cross-Chain Gaming Project - TrashCan & Battlement

## **Project Overview**

This project demonstrates **cross-chain interoperability** in gaming by integrating **Python-based games with blockchain technology**. Players earn points by playing the games, which can be **converted into DeolaX tokens** on **Solana** and used across different blockchains like Flow.

## **Games Included**

1. **TrashCan** – A game where trash falls from the top, and players control a trash can to collect it.
2. **Battlement** – A game where the player dodges falling obstacles to survive as long as possible.

## **Key Features**

✅ Scoring system in both games
✅ Game-over conditions
✅ Progressive difficulty (levels, increasing speed)
✅ DeolaX token integration (Solana-based)
✅ Cross-chain interoperability with Flow Blockchain

## **Technology Stack**

- **Python (Tkinter)** – Game development
- **Solana (Solana Program Library - SPL)** – Token creation & management
- **Flow Blockchain** – Cross-chain integration

## **How to Run the Games**

### **Requirements**

- Python 3.x installed
- Tkinter (included with Python)
- Solana CLI (for token integration)
- Flow CLI (for cross-chain testing)

### **Running the Games**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd cross-chain-gaming
   ```
2. Run the games:
   ```bash
   python trashcan.py
   ```
   ```bash
   python battlement.py
   ```

## **Blockchain Integration**

- Players’ scores can be **converted into DeolaX tokens**.
- Tokens are created on **Solana** using SPL.
- Players can **bridge** their tokens to **Flow Blockchain** for cross-chain usability.

## **Future Enhancements**

- Automate token redemption
- Expand the game library
- Develop a **marketplace for in-game rewards**
