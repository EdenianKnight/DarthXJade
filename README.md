I am taking part in a hackaton. The above is the challenge. I am thinking of building two bare bones games with python. These games should not take more than a few hours to build as I have 18 hours to complete the hackathon. I want there to be a scoring system.
We will also create a token (DeolaX) on solana. these tokens can then be mined using the score points from the games.  Can the above challenge be aligned to my idea?
