Hackathon Project Presentation - DarthXJade (TrashCan & Battlement)
Slide 1: Title Slide
* Title: "TrashCan & Battlement – Gaming Meets Blockchain Rewards"
* Subtitle: "Cross-Chain Interoperability in Gaming"
* Our Name | OvieOla
________________


Slide 2: The Problem
Gaming Rewards Are Limited:
* Most in-game rewards stay within the game and have no real-world value.
* Players invest time, but their rewards can’t be used elsewhere.
* Blockchain can fix this by making in-game rewards valuable & transferable.
________________


Slide 3: Our Solution
* We built two simple games: TrashCan & Battlement.
* Players earn points by playing.
* Points can be converted into DeolaX tokens on Solana.
* Tokens can be used across different blockchains (Flow compatibility).
________________


Slide 4: How It Works
1. Games (Python Tkinter) → Players earn points.
2. Points → Converted into DeolaX Tokens (Solana-based).
3. Cross-Chain Integration → Use tokens on Flow Blockchain.
4. Players Can Trade or Use Tokens in Other Games.
