# TrashCan & Battlement - Python Tkinter Games

## Description

This project contains two simple games built using Python's Tkinter library:

1. **TrashCan** – A game where trash falls from the top, and the player controls a trash can to catch it. The game has multiple levels with increasing difficulty.
2. **Battlement** – A game where the player moves left and right to dodge falling obstacles.

Both games include:

- A **scoring system**
- A **game-over condition**
- **Progressive difficulty**

## How to Run the Games

### Requirements

- Python 3.x installed
- Tkinter (included with Python)

### Running the Games

1. Download the project files.
2. Open a terminal or PowerShell in the project directory.
3. Run the desired game using:
   ```bash
   python trashcan.py
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python battlement.py
   ```

## Game Controls

- **Arrow Left** (`←`): Move left
- **Arrow Right** (`→`): Move right

## Game Rules

### TrashCan

- Catch falling trash to earn points.
- Missing 5 trash items results in **Game Over**.
- Every 10 points, the level increases (trash falls faster and in greater numbers).

### Battlement

- Dodge falling obstacles.
- Collision with an obstacle results in **Game Over**.
- Score increases as obstacles pass the player.
